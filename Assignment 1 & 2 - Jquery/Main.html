	<h2>Why a California Roll?</h2>
	<p>Aaah, the humble California Roll. 
 It has enjoyed immense popularity in the West as the "face" of Sushi.  For many who live in North America, it was likely their first foray into Japanese cuisine.  Light, simple, and favourable to the palate, it isn't hard to understand why the California Roll has cemented itself as the standard, go-to Sushi Roll for many diners for the past several decades.</p>

<p class="reveal">The history of the California Roll is foggy at best, with two standout claims being made that rise above all others, and opinions have been divided for years over where it's true origins lie.  Chef <strong>Hidekazu Tojo</strong> has told his story of creating the first California Roll in Vancouver, Canada after immigrating to BC and experimenting with new flavours and ingredients indigenous to the West Coast in the 1970s.  However, Chef <strong>Ichiro Mashita</strong> of Los Angeles, California has claimed the rights to the dish dating back almost a decade earlier, inventing the Roll in the 60s in America after implementing avocado into the recipe. </p>
<p class="reveal">To this day, the true origins of the California Roll remain a mystery, and who you chose to believe is up to you.  One thing is certain though...no matter where it came from, the California Roll is a crowd-pleasing favourite that's here to stay!</p>

<p>Place the rice into a mixing bowl and cover with cool water. Swirl the rice in the water, pour off and repeat 2 to 3 times or until the water is clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Place the rice and 2 cups of water into a medium saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<p>Combine the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl and heat in the microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer the rice into a large wooden or glass mixing bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Fold thoroughly to combine and coat each grain of rice with the mixture. Allow to cool to room temperature before using to make sushi or sashimi.</p>

<h3>Preparing the California roll</h3>

<div class="highlight">
<p>Squeeze the lemon juice over the avocado to prevent browning.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<p>Cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap. Cut nori sheets in half crosswise. Lay 1 sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic covered mat. Wet your fingers with water and spread about 1/2 cup of the rice evenly onto the nori. </p>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<p>Sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds. Turn the sheet of nori over so that the rice side is down. Place 1/8 of the cucumber, avocado and crab sticks in the center of the sheet. Grab the edge of the mat closest to you, keeping the fillings in place with your fingers, and roll it into a tight cylinder, using the mat to shape the cylinder. Pull away the mat and set aside. Cover with a damp cloth. Repeat until all of the rice has been used. Cut each roll into 6 pieces. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.</p>

<p>One of the wonderful aspects of the California Roll is its culinary simplicity.  Think of it as the blank canvas of the Sushi world.  From humble beginnings can spring endless possibilities!  You can truly take the default California Roll, get creative, and really make it your own.  Try substituting brown rice over white for richer flavour and added nutritional value or thin slices of <strong>zucchini</strong>, <strong>asparagus</strong>, or <strong>sweet bell pepper</strong> in place of cucumber to add a little variety to each roll you make.  Try sprinkling sesame seeds on top of your roll, or even some colourful masago.  Sushi is a dining experience as much as a meal, and the potential for experimentation and personal flair is limitless.  And just like the California Roll itself, you can grow from modest and elementary beginnings into something wonderful.  So don't be afraid...let's roll!</p>
